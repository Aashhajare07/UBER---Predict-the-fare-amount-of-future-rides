###**Project: UBER** -Predict-the-fare-amount-of-future-rides.
## Problem Statement -
The fare amount of a ride is influenced by various factors such as distance, duration, traffic conditions, time of day, and demand. Your goal is to develop a regression model that can predict the fare amount based on these factors. You will work with a dataset that includes historical ride data, including the fare amount and relevant features.
